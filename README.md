**System Verilog Projects**

- A portfolio of SystemVerilog projects demonstrating a range of modeling techniques and hardware design practices.
- These projects are done on **Questa Sim-64 10.7c**

**- Notes for 8-Bit RCA Project**
  -  This design is based on hierarchical design
  -  The half adder and full adder are seperate modules within the same project and can be called as many times as needed
  -  Lastly, gate-level structural design concepts were used


**- Notes for BCD to 7 Segment Decoder**
  -  This design is based on behavioral design, this doesnt it mean that it cannot be hierarchical.
  -  The difference from the 8-Bit RCA project is the difference of design as that was gate level modelling and this is behavioral
